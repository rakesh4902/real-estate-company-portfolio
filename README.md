# Assignment

The assignment is to create a portfolio website for any of the following industries:

An accounting and bookkeeping consulting firm
A dentist
A real estate company

It should be a 3 page website - Home, about and contact

Depicting every aspect of what usually goes into such websites
Written content does not matter. It is the elements , styles, sections and relevance you will be judged most on. 
Adding custom Javascript codes to Wix developer mode or similar functions on other platforms for different sections for transitions and animations is a plus.
The goal is to see how creative and relevant information you can think and come up with for the website. 
Platforms you can use: Wix, Wordpress, Webflow all are free to develop on. Wix and webflow websites can even be published for free with a watermark.
There are ample tutorials for the same online on YouTube and the learning curve for each is also not a big one.
Please refrain from using the default templates on each of those platforms as it will be marked negatively. However you are free to take inspiration from those.


Examples:

https://thedentaloffice.in/
https://kmkventures.com/
https://accountables.com/
 

Note: 
If you want to use webflow you take refer the below resource

Webflow Resources 

Beginner - Level1 
https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101
Beginner - Level 2
https://university.webflow.com/courses/21-day-portfolio-course
These two would be helpful and they should be able to build webpages..

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
